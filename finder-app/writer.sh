#    Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr
#
#    Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified
#
#    Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
