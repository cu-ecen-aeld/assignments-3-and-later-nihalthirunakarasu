* Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a full path to a file 
* (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile; the 
* second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, 
* referred to below as writestr
* Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above 
* were not specified
* Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, 
* overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. Exits 
* with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
