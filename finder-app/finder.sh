# Write a shell script finder-app/finder.sh as described below:
#
#    Accepts the following runtime arguments: the first argument is a path to a directory on the filesystem, referred to below as filesdir; the second argument is a text string which will be searched within these files, referred to below as searchstr
#
#    Exits with return value 1 error and print statements if any of the parameters above were not specified
#
#    Exits with return value 1 error and print statements if filesdir does not represent a directory on the filesystem
#
#    Prints a message "The number of files are X and the number of matching lines are Y" where X is the number of files in the directory and all subdirectories and Y is the number of matching lines found in respective files.
